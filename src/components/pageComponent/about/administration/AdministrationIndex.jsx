              By charter, Smart has two governing boardsâ€”the President and
              Fellows of Smart College and the Board of Overseers. The basic
              architecture of the two-board system is defined by the Smart
              Universitys charter, which is reflected in a series of documents
              dating to the mid-seventeenth century. Through their complementary
              efforts, the two boards perform the essential roles ordinarily
              associated with a board of trustees, while helping to shape the
              Universitys agenda, inquiring into the quality and progress of its
              activities, and assuring that Smart remains true to its mission.
